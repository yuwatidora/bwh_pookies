# Mama Well 
Inspired by the strong mothers around us, Mama Well is a postpartum care app that seeks to fill a crucial gap in women's health, catering to their needs during a vulnerable period. We aimed to leverage technology to make support more accessible and simplify self-care practices, ensuring that mothers receive the assistance and attention they deserve during their postpartum journey.

## Inspiration ðŸŽ‚
After mothers go through labor, a lot of the time the attention for care goes entirely towards the baby from the mother, father and the doctors too. It's time to start taking care of our mothers as they navigate through this stage of motherhood!
## What it does ðŸ¥š
[desc of features]

## How we built it ðŸ”¨
We used react Native to create a mobile 

## Challenges we ran into ðŸ›‘
Some challenges we ran into were figuring out how we can incoporate firebase into our app, along with figuring out how to route to different pages through react Native.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of ðŸš€
We are really happy to have implmented so many of our designs into code. The designs are so so fun and colorful and we are really proud that we finish all of it in such a short amount of time.

## What we learned ðŸ’­
We definitely feel more comfortable using GitHub now! We also really got good at styling our frontend app because of the amount of different feature the applciation had. Along with understanding how react native apps are routed .

## What's next for [title]ðŸ¤”
One thing we wanted to implement was to include a community forum where postpartum mothers are able to chat about their experiences and also share advice and encourage each other. We believe that especially for mothers who are in the postpartum stage, it makes it difficult for them to go out and socialize so we hope to expand our platform so that they have a safe space to share their experience and recover well! We also hoped to incorporate an AI Buddy fro those who may feel uncomfortable getting advice from other individual in case of being judged. In that case, we hope to build a JUDGEMENT FREE AI Buddy that will give you all the advice and support you need from it!
